title: "Developer contributions"
---
A policy introduced in the [1990 Town and Country Planning Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/2E) means that in order gain planning permission a property developer may be required to provide a contribution to mitigate any impact to local infrastructure.

The contributions can be financial or non-financial. For instance, a developer may be required to provide a percentage of affordable housing within a new property development, or they may be required to provide a financial contribution to increase the intake of a local school.

The type, amount, and purpose of the contribution is formalised in something called a [Section 106](/glossary/section-106/) agreement, and is often determined after a series of negotiations between a property developer and the local planning authority. At the start of the negotiations the property developer will produce a viability assessment, typically large technical documents often over several hundred pages long, which outlines their potential return and the amount they deem viable to contribute.

title: "Net development value"
---

The net development value is the estimated amount of money that a property development expects to make once all costs ([land value] (/wiki/benchmark-land-value), development, marketing etc) and [sales] (/wiki/gross-development-value) have been taken into consideration.

As a part of the [viability assessment] (/wiki/viability-assessment) a third party may work with a property developer and local authority to ensure that estimates reflect current market values.

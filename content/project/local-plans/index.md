[Local plans](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-plans) set out local planning policies and identify how land is used, determining what will be built where. They are a rich source of information, but the equally useful data used to produce them isn’t easily extracted from them.

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is working with local planning authorities to design a data format for publishing local plan data so that it’s easy to find, use and trust.

[Local plans](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-plans) set out local planning policies and identify how land is used, determining what will be built where. They are a rich source of information, but the equally useful data used to produce them isn’t easily extracted from them.


The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is working with local planning authorities to design a data format for publishing local plan data so that it’s easy to find, use and trust.

## Current areas of investigation

The following areas of investigation demonstrate possible ways the data might be applied and made easier to work with:

### A timetable for local plan production

#### Questions we’re asking

There is no central record of where local planning authorities are in the process of producing their local plans. Would creating one be useful to users of local plans?  What would a useful one record of local plan production look like?


### A resource showing local authorities’ targets for housing units

#### Questions we’re asking

There is no central resource indicating the number of housing units each local planning authority has promised. Would it be possible to aggregate this data accurately and what form would be most useful to potential users of this data?

### A record of geographies in local plans

#### Questions we're asking

Local plans contain data mapped to geographical areas. While useful, they can be difficult to extract as data. Would it be possible to build a central record of geographies in local plans? Would this be useful to users of data – and what would it look like?

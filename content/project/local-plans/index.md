[Local plans](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-plans) are a rich source of information, however once the documents are published the underlying data isn't available. 

The [Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government) is working with local planning authorities to design a data format for publishing local plan data.

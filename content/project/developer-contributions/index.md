The [National Planning Policy Framework] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2) introduces the need for a [planning authority](/glossary/planning-authority/) to publish their [developer contributions](/glossary/developer-contributions/)

The way planning authorities currently publish these varies, and the inconsistent formats means the data is difficult to compare and hard to consume in bulk. The process of compiling and publishing these is also time-consuming for planning authorities.

The Digital Land team and the Developer Contribution policy team at MHCLG are trying to fix this. We’re working with planning authorities to design and test a new data standard for [Section 106 agreements](/glossary/section-106/) and [viability assessments](/glossary/viability-assessment). We’re also developing tools and guidance to help the people involved in collecting and making the data available.

We have published [a blog post](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/16/making-developer-contributions-open-and-transparent/) with more information about this project.

#### Questions we're asking

Section 106 contributions are published as documents. Would offering planning authorities a simple form enable them to identify pertinent information from within the document and publish it as summary data?

#### What we tested
* [a tool to collect Section 106 data](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/create-section106)

#### What we've learned

Many planning authorities are already using third party tools to help manage their developer contributions. Asking to double-key much of the same data into an additional form would become burdensome and likely lead to a poor quality of data.

#### Questions we're asking

Finding published viability assessments is extremely difficult. Would providing an index of viability assessments, along with important information, be of value to local authorities and interested members of the community?

#### What we tested

* [an index of viability assessments](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/viability/)

#### What we learned

We haven’t yet tested the index with users.

#### Questions we're asking

Will presenting what contribution agreements have been made, where funds have been allocated, and whether money has been spent help answer questions from the community, local authorities and government? 

#### What we tested

* [a visualisation of developer contribution data](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/developer-contributions/section106-wide)

#### What we learned

We haven’t yet tested the dashboard with users.

## Upcoming areas of investigation

We plan to explore the following by prototyping tools and by testing with and consulting people involved with developer contributions:

* Extracting Section 106 data from third party tools
* An index of viability assessments (we will work with planning authorities to populate and test this)
* Determine whether tracking projects is useful
* Determine if ‘developer contributions’ is the correct terminology to use
* Is it possible to have a standardised set of contribution purposes?
* What dates are important and do we need to capture them?
* How do we capture non-financial obligations as data?

## Help us improve developer contributions

Your input is invaluable to our efforts to create a data standard for developer contributions that:

* makes the data more findable and useable for planning authorities
* doesn’t disrupt your current processes 

Please share your thoughts on the proposed data standard and the tools and guidance we’re prototyping here by completing [this feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/aVckvO6woUxUIEjF2).

## Data fields

We want to start with the most minimal data model that addresses the user needs we've identified. We're working on a proposed data specification at the moment, but here's an early view of what we're thinking about.

The [National Planning Policy Framework] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2) introduces the need for a [planning authority](/glossary/planning-authority/) to publish their [developer contributions](/glossary/developer-contributions/)

The way planning authorities currently publish these varies, and the inconsistent formats means the data is difficult to compare and hard to consume in bulk. The process of compiling and publishing these is also time-consuming for planning authorities.

The Digital Land team and the Developer Contribution policy team at MHCLG are working to address these problems. We’re working with planning authorities to design and test a new data standard for [Section 106 agreements](/glossary/section-106/) and [viability assessments](/glossary/viability-assessment). We’re also developing tools and guidance to help the people involved in collecting and making the data available. We’re consulting those users and will be testing our prototypes with them.

We have published [a blog post](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/16/making-developer-contributions-open-and-transparent/) with more information about this project.

#### Questions we're asking

Section 106 contributions are published as documents. Would offering planning authorities a simple form enable them to identify pertinent information from within the document and publish it as summary data?

#### What we tested
* [a tool to collect Section 106 data](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/create-section106)

#### What we've learned

Through speaking with planning authorities we learned that many were already using third party tools to help them manage their developer contributions. Asking to double-key much of the same data into an additional form would become burdensome and likely lead to a poor quality of data.

#### Questions we're asking

Finding published viability assessments is extremely difficult. Would providing an index of viability assessments, along with key information be of value to local authorities and interested members of the community?

#### What we tested

* [an index of viability assessments](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/viability/)

#### What we learned

We haven’t yet tested the index with users.

## Upcoming areas of investigation

* explore the feasibility of getting Section 106 data out of third party tools
* design and test an aggregated view of the developer contribution data
* work with planning authorities to populate and test the index of viability assessments
* determine whether tracking projects is useful
* determine if ‘developer contributions’ is the correct terminology to use

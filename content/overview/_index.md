Housing data finds its origin in real-world needs – the needs of the community, of developers, of the environment – all of which legislation and regulation tries to balance.

Legislation gives rise to what we term land and housing ‘concerns’, of which there are more than 300. 

These comprise:

* “constraints” for planning (eg tree preservation orders)
* “charges” for conveyancing

These concerns are legislation’s attempts to address real world needs. People involved with land and housing must submit data to comply with these concerns.

Much data is made available under an open government licence, but with additional, restrictive terms.

National [radon data] (/wiki/radon), for example, commissioned by the [Health and Safety Executive] (/wiki/health-and-safety-executive) is made available “for planning purposes only” and one [brownfield register] (/wiki/brownfield-site) publisher explicitly warns against building services which compete with Ordnance Survey.

Such restrictions limit unforseen, innovative use-cases for the data.

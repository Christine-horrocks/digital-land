We learned there are many points of friction when building services on top of government data.

None of these points of friction by themselves are insurmountable to someone wanting to use any individual dataset once, but is a burden on people building services which need information only available from government.

The cumulative effect of these individual points of friction, multiplied across each dataset, and repeated in each company needing.

The work needed to discover, find and use data, and the lack of trust in data published by government, is a significant barrier to innovation.

As we progress through the alpha phase we intend to test various hypothesis though prototyping various tools.

Each alpha has an associated priority. These are likely to change the more we learn throughout alpha:
* now = things that we're working on in the next couple of months
* next = planned work for the next 3 to 4 months
* later = anticipated work in the next 5 to 6 months

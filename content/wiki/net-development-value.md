The net development value is the estimated amount of money that a property development expects to make once all costs ([land value] (benchmark-land-value.md), development, marketing etc) and [sales] (gross-development-value.md) have been taken into consideration.

As a part of the [viability assessment] (viability-assessment.md) a third party may work with a property developer and local authority to ensure that estimates reflect current market values.

A local land charge is a restriction on a piece of land or property that can limit its use or bind the owner to a payment of a sum of money. Charges can include:

* planning decisions
* road agreements
* [tree preservation orders] (/tree-preservation-order.md)
* conservation areas and listed buildings notices
* environmental health notices
* charges or objections made against previous owners

A local land charges search will highlight these charges and help you to make an informed choice about buying the parcel of land or property.
